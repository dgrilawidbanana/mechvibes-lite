## Windows
!!! info
    Minimum Python version required is `3.10`. Please check by running `python3
    --version`.

I would recommend installing Scoop on your system by clicking
[here](https://scoop.sh/). It is a package manager. Once you have it installed,
you are to install Python through it, which you can do by following the
instructions for the first result [here](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=python).

Once you have Python installed, do this:
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/eeriemyxi/mechvibes-lite
```

Now you can follow the usage guide of Mechvibes Lite [here](../index.md/#usage).
